Work Experience:
  2006: |
    <b>Three-months Internship</b>

    <b>Web Developer</b>
    Freelancer - Albignasego (PD) - Italy

    As a freelancer, I have developed a wide range of web applications. This includes everything from classic business websites and e-commerce platforms to product configurators, content management systems (CMS), web management software, and even social networks. I've had the opportunity to work on projects for major companies like Radio 105 and Selle Italia. While I specialize in backend development, I'm also proficient in frontend technologies, with solid knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with React.

    <b>Leader Backend Developer</b>
    Timerepublik S.A. - Albignasego (PD) - Italy / Lugano - Switzerland

    I designed and developed the backend for the Timerepublik web application, a talent-exchange social network. Conceived by two Swiss entrepreneurs, the platform allows users to exchange favors and pay with time units that function as a real currency. This project was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my mastery of Rails and to solve the unique challenges that come with building a social network. I also gained valuable experience working as part of a team and got a glimpse into the Swiss tech scene.

    <b>Full Stack Web Developer</b>
    Uqido s.r.l. - Padova - Italy

    When I realized that my freelance work was no longer challenging me, I decided to seek a new opportunity that would allow me to grow, learn new things, and collaborate with other industry experts. This led me to Uqido, a rapidly growing software house specializing in web applications and virtual reality. I was immediately able to tackle large and incredibly interesting projects. Uqido operates with a high standard for both technology and methodology, which has allowed me to learn a great deal. For example, I've started working on projects with massive databases where efficient searching is critical, and I've found a powerful tool in Elasticsearch. Furthermore, I've begun to master the Agile methodology, which has significantly improved my ability to work both independently and with a team. I'm very happy with this new professional direction.

  "October 2019\nPresent": |
    <b>Senior Web Developer</b>
    CardTrader s.r.l.s. - Limena (PD) - Italy

    After years of freelancing and developing a variety of web applications for different clients, I transitioned to a new role at CardTrader (https://cardtrader.com). This company runs an Amazon-style marketplace for trading collectibles. This change has radically shifted my approach to work. Instead of managing multiple projects of varying durations, I now focus exclusively on a single project. This new model has allowed me to gain significant experience in writing highly maintainable code—because I know that the code I write today, I'll have to understand and modify tomorrow. At CardTrader, in addition to strengthening my skills in Rails and React, I have also put my system administration skills into practice by configuring and setting up the various servers that form the backbone of CardTrader's web and non-web infrastructure.
