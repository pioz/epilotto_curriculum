Work Experience:
  April 2009 – present: |
    <b>Web developer</b>
    Freelancer - Albignasego (PD) - Italy

    In these years as freelancer I have developed many web applications of all kinds: from classic dynamic business websites to important e-commerce, product configurators, CMS, web management software and even social networks. I have developed projects for large companies such as Radio 105 and Selle Italia. Although I prefer the backend development of an application, I can easily move in the frontend, in fact I have good knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, also experienced in developing interfaces in React.

  April 2012 – February 2017: |
    <b>Leader backend developer</b>
    Timerepublik S.A. - Albignasego (PD) - Italy / Lugano - Switzerland

    I have designed and developed the backend of the Timerepublik web application, a social network for the exchange of talents in exchange for time. Created by the idea of two Swiss people, in this community, users can exchange favours and pay with time units that act as a real currency. It was great to work on this project that definitely gave me the chance to increase my Rails mastery, but also to solve many problems that in an application like this one has to deal with. Also I could experience working in real team and know a little about Swiss realities.
